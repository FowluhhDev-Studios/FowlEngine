## Using FowlEngine

You can just clone the repo as it serves as the source and a template with the example program file. This framework runs on Raylib for Python so make sure to install it with `pip3 install raylib`

If you want to make your own game, then look around in the "fowl" folder and look in each file as there is no documentation as of now.
